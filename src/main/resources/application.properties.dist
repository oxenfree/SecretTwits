# This file is a "template" of what your application.properties file should look like.
# Change the APIKey to the actual key you get from www.opensecrets.org.
# Change the CandIndCycles and MemPFDYyears to whatever the latest cycles are available 
# from www.opensecrets.org. As of 2017, the cycles are 2012,2014,2016 (no spaces). 
# This will change in 2018. The User Agent is there because www.opensecrets.com won't
# accept incoming API calls from software which is not a browser. 
# If you get a "403" code (Forbidden) from opensecrets change the User Agent to reflect
# a modern web browser. In 2017, the string provided below is a Google Chrome user agent.
# When you've done all that, rename this file "application.properties" (drop the ".dist")
# and you're off to the races.
